          <p>Our next DDaT Together event will be held at the Kia Oval on Wednesday 27 February.</p>
          <p>We are fortunate to have two keynote speakers on the day: Mark Thomson, Director General, HM Passport Office, in the morning and Shona Dunn, Second Permanent Secretary, in the afternoon.</p>
          <p>This event is open to everyone in DDaT but space is limited so places will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
          <p>Don’t forget to bring your Home Office pass. We don’t want you to wear it but you must show it when you arrive at The Kia Oval. If you don’t bring it, you may not be able to take part for security reasons.</p>
          <p>Any questions? Please contact the <a href="mailto:hoddatcommunications@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">DDaT communications team</a>.</p>
